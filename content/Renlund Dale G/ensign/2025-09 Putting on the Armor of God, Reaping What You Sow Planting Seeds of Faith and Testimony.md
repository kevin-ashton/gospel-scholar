# Putting on the Armor of God, Reaping What You Sow: Planting Seeds of Faith and Testimony

Elder Dale G. Renlund

Brothers and sisters, it's a delight for me to be here. I've looked forward to this. I'm grateful to be with my wife. It turns out that people like me better when they've met her first. It also turns out that she, chose to become a lawyer. And so she's a lawyer—a recovering lawyer now. And I used to be a physician, and that's why we have a hard time making friends. So that's why we've come to Ensign College—to see if we can scare up a few friends.

I am under an injunction from my wife to not tell lawyer jokes over the pulpit. I asked her when she's going to rescind that, and she said, “Well, never, because the recidivism rate would be too high.” And I think she's right.

We're so impressed with you as we listen to President and Sister Kush talk about you and how proud they are of you. To think that so many of you speak multiple languages, and you come here and work in English.

And you listen, say, to Eduarda as she gave that beautiful invocation—and to know that her native language is Portuguese, and she speaks English so beautifully.

Do you know what you call someone who speaks three languages? You call them trilingual. If they speak two languages, you call them bilingual. If they speak one, you call them an American.

I'm so grateful for all of you—that you take time to be here today.

Life presents difficulties and challenges for us all. Those familiar with Shakespeare's Hamlet are familiar with the phrase “slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.”1 Sometimes we may feel like we're being used for target practice.“Slings and arrows” represent hardships, setbacks, and unfairness that sometimes feel like “outrageous fortune.”

Given the fallen nature of mortality, we're wise to use the protections God has provided. The Apostle Paul advised “putting on the armor of God” to describe seeking the Lord's protection to withstand strategies that our enemies generally, and Satan specifically, use to harm us or lead us away from God.2In modern terms, we equip ourselves to meet the trials of mortality, to keep ourselves safe, and to resist temptation, both spiritually and physically.

Four pieces of armor that help protect us from metaphorical slings and arrows of outrageous fortune are 1) scriptures, 2) words of the living prophets, 3) official Church content, and 4) counsel from trusted advisors. As we put these on, “We will be fortified against worldly influences that could otherwise lead us to become adrift, isolated, and…alienated”3 from God.

When we put on this armor, leaving no gaps, we create a zone of safety.4 Staying within that zone provides the best opportunity to survive. Before talking about the individual pieces of armor, let me share with you an embarrassing story from my mid-teens when I stepped outside of my safety zone.

My father was a building contractor. My brother Gary and I frequently worked with him on weekends and during school breaks. Gary was older, bigger, and stronger than I was. He and I were never competitive with each other—except when it came to framing walls of 2x4s nailed together using long 16-penny nails.

Now, instead of using a regular claw hammer like this one, we would use a longer, heavier framing hammer like this one. It's about a third heavier than the claw hammer. Using the framing hammer, we could drive in the nails with three strokes. The first tap set the nail, and the next two drove the nail home: tap, whack, whack. Tap, whack, whack. Gary and I would lay out a wall and then see who could nail the most 2x4s in place.

One day, our father noticed our competition. Without a word, Dad picked up his carpenter's axe, much like this one. It's about a third again heavier and longer than the framing hammers. Dad joined us at the wall. He used the flat edge of the axe to drive the nails home with just two strokes. The first stroke not only set the nail but drove it nearly halfway in. With the second stroke, he hammered the nail home. Just whack-whack, whack-whack. As a result, he framed much faster.

After Dad left, I decided to try Dad's technique. I overlooked the fact that Dad was a far more skilled carpenter than I was. He had been hammering nails home for decades. I borrowed Dad's axe, knowing I would gain a competitive advantage over Gary.

Everything went extremely well with the first three nails. Whack-whack, whack-whack. I felt so proud of myself.

On the fourth nail, though, with the first stroke, I missed the nail altogether and smashed the tips of my index and third fingers. Not whack-whack. Just… splat. Not wanting to confess my stupidity, I switched back to using my framing hammer. Now I needed to gingerly hold the nail with my thumb and fourth finger. It took approximately four taps to even set the nail: tap, tap, tap, tap, whack, whack. This wounded-finger technique left me further behind Gary.

But about two hours later, the discomfort in my injured fingertips was severe. Blood had built up under the two fingernails I'd hit, causing pressure that was extremely painful.5 When I couldn't stand it anymore, I confessed to my dad and showed him my smashed fingers. I thought I might get some sympathy from him. I should have known better. Without saying anything, he placed my fingers on a sawhorse, took a power drill, and gently and carefully drilled small holes through my fingernails, releasing the pressure from the built-up blood. Immediately the pain diminished. Then Dad just motioned with his head for me to go back to work. I eventually lost both fingernails and have scars to remind myself of my brilliance—and never again used a carpenter's axe as a framing hammer.

From this experience, I learned some important lessons. The first is that you can't repent of stupidity – even though some foolish actions resulting from stupidity do require repentance, in this case my dad didn’t need to lecture me. The lesson was learned. When I stepped outside my safety zone, it had painful consequences.

Most of us need to be taught to stay within a zone of safety for our own spiritual and physical protection. We don't need to conduct experiments for ourselves. We simply need to use the armor that the Lord has given us, leaving no gaps. One way or another, all four pieces of armor that we'll talk about point to Jesus Christ.

The first piece of armor is studying, using, and applying the scriptures. Consistent study of the scriptures strengthens faith in Jesus Christ. Reading scriptures is not a box to check off on our to-do list. It has more to do with connecting with our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and accessing Their power. The late Apostle Elder Robert D. Hales taught, “When we want to speak to God, we pray. And when we want Him to speak to us, we search the scriptures.”6

Teachings found in the scriptures, especially in the Book of Mormon, fortify and protect us spiritually. President Russell M. Nelson said, “I promise that as you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon every day, you’ll make better decisions—every day. I promise that …. the windows of heaven will open and you’ll receive answers to your own questions and direction for your own life. I promise that … you can be immunized against the evils of the day, even … mind-numbing addictions.”7

The invitation to read the Book of Mormon every day is captured in one of the children’s songs that will be part of the new hymn collection, “Hymns: For Home and Church.” And I must say, having had some responsibility for this new hymnal since 2021… I think the War in Heaven started over a new hymnal!

We asked the choir to sing hymn number 136, “Read the Book of Mormon and Pray.” If they stood in place and sang, and once everyone got the hang of it, we invited all to join in singing with the choir.  

1.  I want to learn to choose the right

And follow in the Savior’s light.  
And I want to know the gospel’s true.  
With faith in Christ, here’s something I can do:  
Read the Book of Mormon and pray  
Ev’ry day, ev’ry day, ev’ry day!  
God will bless me with His pow’r,  
Teach and guide me hour by hour  
When I read the Book of Mormon and pray  
Ev’ry day, ev’ry day, ev’ry day!

2.      The Book of Mormon helps me see  
The ways of Christ, His love for me.  
When I have a question or a choice,  
I read this book and listen to His voice.  
Read the Book of Mormon and pray  
Ev’ry day, ev’ry day, ev’ry day!  
God will bless me with His pow’r,  
Teach and guide me hour by hour  
When I read the Book of Mormon and pray  
Ev’ry day, ev’ry day, ev’ry day!

Thank you so much, choir, for doing that—and those bold souls who joined in. It’s a wonderful song, and it has a simple message that can have a profound effect in our lives.

Additional protective blessings have been promised by Church leaders when we immerse ourselves in the Book of Mormon. These promises include help with weakness and discouragement; decreased concerns and anxieties; greater ability to overcome doubt and fear; power to resist temptation; strength to overcome bad habits; greater ability to stay on the straight and narrow path; lighten burdens; and decreased susceptibility to deception.

But these promises are not just reserved for the Book of Mormon. These blessings apply to the other standard works as well. Many years ago, while my wife and I were in South Africa, we met a man named Alex Mmbatha, a senior official in the government of South Africa at the time. He had been a trusted associate of Nelson Mandela. Alex told us about the first time he was imprisoned. He was locked in a cold cell with twenty-five others for months. The light in the cell stayed on twenty-four hours a day, and those who were incarcerated had nothing to do. Early in the imprisonment, the warden took pity on Alex and gave him a Bible. Alex began reading. On his third time through the Bible, scriptural passages seemed to lift up off the page and link up with other biblical passages. These “scripture chains,” said Alex, brought him peace and comfort. He told us that now, when he reads his Bible, it always feels like coming home. We can have a similar experience with the scriptures if we read as Alex did—every day. Every day. Every day.

The second piece of armor we need is to follow the living prophet. We believe in ongoing revelation through a prophet of God. This claim is audacious and extraordinary—but it’s true. Let me point out something that should be obvious, though: in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we worship Jesus Christ. He is the head of the Church. Joseph Smith said, “The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.”8 In other words, the Atonement of Jesus Christ is central to our faith. However, one of the unique aspects of our faith is that we’re led by Jesus Christ through a living prophet.

On January 2, 2018, President Thomas S. Monson passed away. On Sunday, January 14, 2018, all living ordained Apostles came fasting to an upper room of the Salt Lake Temple. We had all been praying that the Savior would make His will known. I confess that I would have trusted the process—but something beyond that happened.

Each Apostle was asked in turn whether the First Presidency should be reorganized and, if so, who the President of the Church should be. It was unanimous that the First Presidency should be reorganized and that President Russell M. Nelson would be the President. We all felt that that was the mind and will of the Savior.

A chair was placed in the middle of the room. President Nelson sat in the chair, and the remaining Apostles each placed his right hand on President Nelson’s head and the other hand on the shoulder of the Apostle next to him. Then Elder Dallin H. Oaks, who was acting as voice, began setting apart and ordaining President Nelson as the President of the Church. As he began, “Russell Marion Nelson…” As he said that, I felt an overwhelming spiritual confirmation of joy and peace. It filled me from head to toe. I can only describe it as Pentecostal. As Elder Oaks proceeded to set apart and ordain President Nelson as the President of the Church, I knew—absolutely knew—I had my hand on the head of God’s prophet on the earth. I wish each of you could have been there. You couldn’t, so the best I can do is to tell you. But God doesn’t want this to be a secret. He’ll let you know for yourself. But knowing cannot simply be an academic request. God will let you know if you are willing to act on that spiritual experience and follow the Prophet.

Sometimes we might be tempted to feel warm and fuzzy about having a living prophet—if he teaches what we already believe and asks us to do things we already want to do. But what if he asks us to accept what we don’t yet believe or behave in a way we would otherwise not have behaved? What do we do then?

Brigham Young provides an example. He said, “Many things which were revealed through Joseph Smith came in contact with our own prejudices: we did not know how to understand them.”9 Now Brigham was acknowledging that the Lord had revealed through the Prophet Joseph things that challenged his personal beliefs. Brigham continued, “When the Vision \[what we now know as Doctrine and Covenants section 76\] first came to me, it was directly contrary and opposed to my former education, and I could not understand it. What I had previously been taught and believed was diametrically opposed to the doctrine revealed in the Vision.”10We need to go back to that time. At that time, most Protestants believed that heaven was very small—reserved only for the select elect—and that hell was huge and would be populated by the majority of people, who were condemned eternally to be tormented in Hell because God abhorred His creations. The teaching of “the Vision” reverses this situation. “The revealed doctrine of the restored Church of Jesus Christ teaches that all the children of God— with exceptions too limited to consider here—will ultimately inherit one of three kingdoms of glory, even the least of which ‘surpasses all understanding.’”11When faced with something from the living prophet that was diametrically opposed to his prior beliefs, Brigham reported, “I said \[to myself\], Wait a little. I did not reject it…. I used to think and pray, to read and think, until I knew and fully understood it for myself, by the visions of the Holy Spirit.”12

When it comes to President Nelson, I suggest we adopt Brigham’s approach. If we don’t understand something, wait—don’t reject. Think, pray, and seek confirmation. President Nelson will always direct us to the Savior. President Nelson’s only concern is our eternal welfare. He can be trusted.

Another piece of armor for us to put on is to rely on official Church content, such as in Church magazines, handbooks, and manuals. These are found in the “sealed” portion of the Gospel Library app. This content is carefully created and curated. When we’re looking for answers to gospel questions or help with Church responsibilities, these resources are irreplaceable.

The “Come, Follow Me” curriculum is so flexible, informative, and easy to use. Church magazines are also a great source of inspiration. If you want to know what’s on the mind of the First Presidency and the Twelve, read the Liahona.

During our gospel study, we may have questions we sincerely wish we had the answers to. Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught, “Asking questions isn’t a sign of weakness,” but rather “it’s a precursor of growth.”13To that end, the Church has compiled a trustworthy and content-rich resource for individuals seeking answers to their own questions and for others who are striving to help them. This content helps strengthen faith in Jesus Christ and provides suggestions for how to approach complex and potentially difficult topics.

This resource can be found on both the Church’s website and in the Gospel Library app. In case you’re not familiar with these resources, let me show you the location within the Gospel Library app: open it and, from the home page, navigate to the Library. Tap the tile “Topics and Questions.” Here you’ll see a section called “Seeking Answers to Questions,” another section called “Helping Others with Questions,” and then an alphabetical listing of numerous topics of potential interest.

The “Seeking Answers to Questions” section teaches principles that can guide our study as we earnestly seek answers to our questions—whether about faith, doctrine, or Church history. The introduction to this section explains that questions are an important part of spiritual growth and that seeking answers can be a lifelong pursuit.

The principles found in this section encourage us to center our lives on Jesus Christ. We’re also reminded that God’s plan of salvation provides perspective for our questions. That perspective helps us distinguish core gospel truths from things that aren’t essential. For faith to grow, we need to choose to have faith; then we must act in faith and hold fast to what we know. As we do, we deepen our understanding of and faith in Jesus Christ.

We’re encouraged to be patient with ourselves, with others, and with the Lord’s timing. Revelation is a process that often starts with questions; answers frequently come line upon line. As we search for answers, we should seek guidance from the Holy Ghost.

The next section, “Helping Others with Questions,” suggests principles that can guide us as we interact with others who have questions. No matter what, we should speak respectfully, listen with empathy, and demonstrate Christlike love. We listen and respond with love. We seek to understand, acknowledge the experiences others have, and we avoid being dismissive or judgmental. Please remember, though, that while we have the fullness of the gospel, we do not have all the answers to all questions we’d like. Some answers will have to wait for further revelation. With some questions, we simply don’t know enough about the will of the Lord and the fullness of gospel doctrine to satisfy all questioners. In these situations, an attempt for you or me to persuade questioners with additional logic or reasons that we come up with may not help. Avoid giving reasons or explanations that the Lord has not given. When that happens, the reason or answer we give may eventually fall apart, and then the individual we were trying to help may have less faith. It’s better to say that we don’t know than it is to fabricate a reason or explanation. Faith is, after all, a choice. And sometimes the only answer is to rely on faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and faith in the Restoration of His gospel—and to be patient, waiting for answers from the Lord when He chooses to reveal them.14 We trust in the Lord and try to be a safe and trusted source for others to turn to for help. Remember that even when others don’t embrace the entirety of the gospel, they may still believe in and be faithful to the words of Jesus Christ.15 When they struggle with an aspect of the Church, they can still have a solid testimony that Heavenly Father loves them and wants what’s best for them, and that Jesus Christ is their Savior.

President Nelson taught, “If friends and family should step away from the Church, continue to love them. It is not for you to judge another’s choice any more than you deserve to be criticized for staying faithful. Now, please hear me when I say: do not be led astray by those whose doubts may be fueled by things you cannot see in their lives. Most of all, let your skeptical friends see how much you love the Lord and His gospel. Surprise their doubting hearts with your believing heart!”16

The content contained in “Topics and Questions” provides essential armor against falsehoods and misrepresentations of Church history and doctrine.

The fourth piece of armor that we need is seeking counsel from trusted advisors who can guide us and help us avoid deception. The Savior knew pretenders would try to deceive the very elect and that many disciples would be duped. We should neither believe those who falsely claim divine sanction nor venture into metaphorical deserts or secret chambers to be taught by counterfeits.17

The Book of Mormon teaches us to trust no one to be your teacher or your minister, except he be a man \[or woman\] of God, walking in His ways and keeping His commandments.18 Disciples always promote believing in God, serving Him, and doing good. We won’t be deceived when we seek and take counsel from trusted individuals who are themselves faithful disciples of the Savior.19 These have our best interests at heart. They’re not advocating their own interests or trying to influence us for their benefit. They’re not seeking our vote or our money.20

These individuals are not those who stir us up to anger against that which is good. They’re not the ones who try to pacify us, saying “All is well,” when it isn’t. They’re not the ones who tell us to simply eat, drink, and be merry.21 These trusted advisors know that “the baseless notion that we should ‘eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die and it shall be well with us’ is one of the most absurd lies in the universe.”22

I’ve found that my most trusted advisors are my wife, daughter, and sisters. They don’t try to manipulate me. They only want me to do the best I can in life and in my apostolic ministry. I’m a better man, and I’m better able to magnify my calling, because of their trusted advice.

Many years ago, I arrived home one evening venting about some individuals at work. Our daughter, Ashley—then ten years old—looked troubled and said, paraphrasing the Sermon on the Mount, “But Dad, I thought we were supposed to pray for those who despitefully use us.” I felt like rebuking her and asking, “Why can’t you just nap during Church like a normal kid?” But her counsel touched my heart. My prayers changed, and my interactions with associates improved, and this led to the resolution of a very significant challenge.

So, my dear friends, put on the whole armor of God. Put on 1) scriptures, 2) words of the living prophets, 3) official Church content, and 4) counsel from trusted advisors. When you do, you create a safety zone that will help you minimize the risks of mortality and of being spiritually wounded by the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. This kind of armor has never been more fashionable. You need it. I need it.

Brothers and sisters, I know—I absolutely know—that Jesus Christ lives. He is your Savior and my Savior, your Redeemer and my Redeemer. He directs His work through a living prophet on the earth today. I know that’s true. I also know that He loves you. He knows you, and He loves you.

Some years ago—just a couple of years ago—we were in Guatemala City, and there was a large choir of Primary children who sang in a devotional. Afterwards, I wanted to shake all their hands because they’d sung their hearts out. I remember kneeling so I could be more “eyeball to eyeball” with them. They came by, and because I don’t know any Spanish, it went very quickly.

Then there was a little boy, probably about seven or eight, who took me by the hand, shaking it—and he wouldn’t let go. I did the Spanish I knew—mucho gusto—and things like that. Then he asked me a question: “¿Cómo está Jesús?” I didn’t understand at first, so I got a translator over and asked, “What’s he saying?” He’s asking, “How is Jesus doing?”

I was struck by the fact that this little boy had enough faith to think that one of the Savior’s Apostles would know how Jesus is doing—and also that he had, at that young age, empathy for Jesus Christ. We expect the Savior’s love to be perfect and infinite, and yet sometimes our love for Him waxes and wanes depending on whether we’re having a good day.

I told him what I’d like to tell you: Jesus loves you. He’s proud of you. He’s proud of the choices you’re making. This is who our Savior is—of His infinite mercy and capacity and love. I know this is true. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
