# Jonah 2

Jonah prays to the Lord, and the fish vomits him out on dry ground.

# 01
THEN Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,

# 02
And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.

# 03
For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.

# 04
Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.

# 05
The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.

# 06
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.

# 07
When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.

# 08
They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

# 09
But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.

# 10
And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
