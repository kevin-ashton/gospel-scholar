# Job 16

Job speaks against the wicked who oppose him—Though even his friends scorn him, he testifies that his witness is in heaven and his record is on high.

# 01
THEN Job answered and said,

# 02
I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.

# 03
Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?

# 04
I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.

# 05
But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.

# 06
Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?

# 07
But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.

# 08
And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.

# 09
He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

# 10
They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.

# 11
God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.

# 12
I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.

# 13
His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.

# 14
He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.

# 15
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.

# 16
My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;

# 17
Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.

# 18
O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.

# 19
Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.

# 20
My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.

# 21
O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!

# 22
When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
