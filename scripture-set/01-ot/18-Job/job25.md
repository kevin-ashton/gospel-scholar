# Job 25

Bildad bemoans the lowly state of man and classifies him as a worm.

# 01
THEN answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

# 02
Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.

# 03
Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?

# 04
How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?

# 05
Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.

# 06
How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?
