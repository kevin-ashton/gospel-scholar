# Job 12

Job says, The souls of all things are in the hands of the Lord, with the ancient is wisdom, and the Lord governs in all things.

# 01
AND Job answered and said,

# 02
No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.

# 03
But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

# 04
I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.

# 05
He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.

# 06
The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.

# 07
But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:

# 08
Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.

# 09
Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?

# 10
In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.

# 11
Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?

# 12
With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.

# 13
With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.

# 14
Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.

# 15
Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.

# 16
With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.

# 17
He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.

# 18
He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.

# 19
He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.

# 20
He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.

# 21
He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.

# 22
He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.

# 23
He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.

# 24
He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.

# 25
They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
