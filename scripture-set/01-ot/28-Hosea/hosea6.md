# Hosea 6

Hosea calls Israel to return and serve the Lord—The mercy and knowledge of God are more important than ritualistic sacrifices.

# 01
COME, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

# 02
After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.

# 03
Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.

# 04
O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.

# 05
Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.

# 06
For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.

# 07
But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.

# 08
Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.

# 09
And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.

# 10
I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.

# 11
Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.
