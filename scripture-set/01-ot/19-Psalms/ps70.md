# Psalms 70

David proclaims, Let God be magnified.

# 01
MAKE haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.

# 02
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.

# 03
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.

# 04
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

# 05
But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
