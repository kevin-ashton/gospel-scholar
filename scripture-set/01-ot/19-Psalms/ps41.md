# Psalms 41

A messianic psalm of David—Blessed is he who considers the poor—The treachery of Judas is foretold.

# 01
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.

# 02
The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.

# 03
The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

# 04
I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.

# 05
Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?

# 06
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.

# 07
All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.

# 08
An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and nowthat he lieth he shall rise up no more.

# 09
Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.

# 10
But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.

# 11
By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.

# 12
And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.

# 13
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
