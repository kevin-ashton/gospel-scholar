# Psalms 14

David says, The fool has said in his heart, there is no God—Israel will rejoice in the day of restoration.

# 01
THE fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.

# 02
The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.

# 03
They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

# 04
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

# 05
There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.

# 06
Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.

# 07
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
