# Psalms 126

The Lord has done great things for His people, Israel.

# 01
WHEN the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.

# 02
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.

# 03
The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.

# 04
Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

# 05
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

# 06
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
