# Psalms 54

David pleads for salvation and promises to serve God.

# 01
SAVE me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

# 02
Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

# 03
For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

# 04
Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.

# 05
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.

# 06
I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.

# 07
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
