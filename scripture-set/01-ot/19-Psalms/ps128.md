# Psalms 128

Blessed are those who fear the Lord and walk in His ways.

# 01
BLESSED is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.

# 02
For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.

# 03
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.

# 04
Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.

# 05
The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

# 06
Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.
