# Psalms 8

A messianic psalm of David—He says that babes and children praise the Lord—He asks, What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?

# 01
O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.

# 02
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.

# 03
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;

# 04
What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?

# 05
For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.

# 06
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:

# 07
All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

# 08
The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.

# 09
O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
