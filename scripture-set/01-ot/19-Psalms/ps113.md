# Psalms 113

Blessed be the name of the Lord—Who is like unto the Lord our God?

# 01
PRAISE ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.

# 02
Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.

# 03
From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised.

# 04
The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.

# 05
Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

# 06
Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!

# 07
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;

# 08
That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.

# 09
He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
