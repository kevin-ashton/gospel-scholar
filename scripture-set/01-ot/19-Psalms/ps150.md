# Psalms 150

Praise God in His sanctuary—Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.

# 01
PRAISE ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.

# 02
Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.

# 03
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp.

# 04
Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.

# 05
Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.

# 06
Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.
