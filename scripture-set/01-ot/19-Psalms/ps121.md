# Psalms 121

Help comes from the Lord—He is the guardian of Israel.

# 01
I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.

# 02
My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.

# 03
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.

# 04
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.

# 05
The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.

# 06
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.

# 07
The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.

# 08
The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
