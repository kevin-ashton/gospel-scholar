# Psalms 149

Praise the Lord in the congregation of the Saints—He will beautify the meek with salvation.

# 01
PRAISE ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.

# 02
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.

# 03
Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.

# 04
For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.

# 05
Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.

# 06
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand;

# 07
To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people;

# 08
To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;

# 09
To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.
