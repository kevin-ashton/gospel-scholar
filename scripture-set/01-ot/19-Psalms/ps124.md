# Psalms 124

David says, Israel’s help is in the name of the Lord.

# 01
IF it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;

# 02
If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:

# 03
Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:

# 04
Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:

# 05
Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

# 06
Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.

# 07
Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

# 08
Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
