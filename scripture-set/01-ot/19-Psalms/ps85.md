# Psalms 85

The Lord speaks peace to His people—Truth will spring out of the earth (the Book of Mormon), and righteousness will look down from heaven.

# 01
LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.

# 02
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.

# 03
Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.

# 04
Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.

# 05
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?

# 06
Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?

# 07
Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

# 08
I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.

# 09
Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.

# 10
Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

# 11
Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.

# 12
Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.

# 13
Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.
