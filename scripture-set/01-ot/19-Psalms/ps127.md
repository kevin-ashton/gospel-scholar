# Psalms 127

Children are a heritage from the Lord.

# 01
EXCEPT the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.

# 02
It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

# 03
Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.

# 04
As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.

# 05
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
