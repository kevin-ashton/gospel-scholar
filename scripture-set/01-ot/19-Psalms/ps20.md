# Psalms 20

David prays that the Lord will hear in time of trouble—The Lord saves His anointed.

# 01
THE LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;

# 02
Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;

# 03
Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.

# 04
Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.

# 05
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

# 06
Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.

# 07
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.

# 08
They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.

# 09
Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
