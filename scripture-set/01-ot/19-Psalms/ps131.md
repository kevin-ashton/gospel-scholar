# Psalms 131

David says, Let Israel hope in the Lord forever.

# 01
LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.

# 02
Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

# 03
Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
