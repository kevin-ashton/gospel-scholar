# Psalms 15

David asks, Who will dwell in the Lord’s holy hill?—He answers, The righteous, the upright, and those with integrity.

# 01
LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?

# 02
He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.

# 03
He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

# 04
In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.

# 05
He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
