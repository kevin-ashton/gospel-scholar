# Psalms 3

David cries unto the Lord and is heard—Salvation is of the Lord.

# 01
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.

# 02
Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.

# 03
But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.

# 04
I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.

# 05
I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.

# 06
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.

# 07
Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.

# 08
Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.
