# Psalms 6

David cries unto the Lord for mercy—He asks to be healed and saved.

# 01
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

# 02
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.

# 03
My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?

# 04
Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.

# 05
For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?

# 06
I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.

# 07
Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.

# 08
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.

# 09
The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.

# 10
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.
