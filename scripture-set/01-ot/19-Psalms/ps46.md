# Psalms 46

God is our refuge and strength—He dwells in His city, does marvelous things, and says, Be still and know that I am God.

# 01
GOD is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

# 02
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

# 03
Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

# 04
There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

# 05
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.

# 06
The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.

# 07
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

# 08
Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.

# 09
He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.

# 10
Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

# 11
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
