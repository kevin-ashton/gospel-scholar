# Psalms 112

Blessed is the man who fears the Lord—The righteous will be remembered always.

# 01
PRAISE ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.

# 02
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.

# 03
Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.

# 04
Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

# 05
A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.

# 06
Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.

# 07
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.

# 08
His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.

# 09
He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.

# 10
The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
