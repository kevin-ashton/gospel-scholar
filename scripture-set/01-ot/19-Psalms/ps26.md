# Psalms 26

David says that he has walked in integrity and obedience—He loves the Lord’s house.

# 01
JUDGE me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.

# 02
Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

# 03
For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.

# 04
I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.

# 05
I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.

# 06
I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:

# 07
That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.

# 08
LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.

# 09
Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

# 10
In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.

# 11
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.

# 12
My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
