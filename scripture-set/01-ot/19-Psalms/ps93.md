# Psalms 93

The Lord reigns—He is from everlasting—Holiness adorns the house of the Lord forever.

# 01
THE LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.

# 02
Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.

# 03
The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.

# 04
The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.

# 05
Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
