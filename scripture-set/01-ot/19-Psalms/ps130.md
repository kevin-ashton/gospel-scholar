# Psalms 130

O Lord, hear our prayers, forgive iniquity, and redeem Israel.

# 01
OUT of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.

# 02
Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.

# 03
If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?

# 04
But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.

# 05
I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.

# 06
My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.

# 07
Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.

# 08
And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
