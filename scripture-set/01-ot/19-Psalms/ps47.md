# Psalms 47

The Lord is King over all the earth—Sing praises to His name, for He reigns over all.

# 01
O CLAP your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.

# 02
For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.

# 03
He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.

# 04
He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

# 05
God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.

# 06
Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.

# 07
For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.

# 08
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.

# 09
The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.
