# Psalms 96

Sing praises unto the Lord—Declare His name among the nations—Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness—He comes to judge His people and the world.

# 01
O SING unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.

# 02
Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.

# 03
Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.

# 04
For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.

# 05
For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.

# 06
Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

# 07
Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.

# 08
Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.

# 09
O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.

# 10
Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.

# 11
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.

# 12
Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice

# 13
Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
