# Psalms 148

Let all things praise the Lord: men and angels, the heavenly bodies, the elements and the earth, and all things thereon.

# 01
PRAISE ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.

# 02
Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.

# 03
Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.

# 04
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens.

# 05
Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.

# 06
He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.

# 07
Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:

# 08
Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word:

# 09
Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:

# 10
Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:

# 11
Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:

# 12
Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:

# 13
Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.

# 14
He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
