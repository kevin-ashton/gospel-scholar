# Psalms 120

Call upon the Lord when in distress.

# 01
IN my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.

# 02
Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.

# 03
What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?

# 04
Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

# 05
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!

# 06
My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.

# 07
I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
