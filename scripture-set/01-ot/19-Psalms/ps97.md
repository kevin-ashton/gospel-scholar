# Psalms 97

The Lord reigns in millennial glory—The hills melt at His presence—Those who love the Lord hate evil.

# 01
THE LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.

# 02
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.

# 03
A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.

# 04
His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.

# 05
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

# 06
The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.

# 07
Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.

# 08
Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.

# 09
For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.

# 10
Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

# 11
Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.

# 12
Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
