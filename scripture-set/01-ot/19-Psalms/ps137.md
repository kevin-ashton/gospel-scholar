# Psalms 137

While in captivity, the Jews wept by the rivers of Babylon—Because of sorrow, they could not bear to sing the songs of Zion.

# 01
BY the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.

# 02
We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

# 03
For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

# 04
How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?

# 05
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.

# 06
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

# 07
Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.

# 08
O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

# 09
Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
