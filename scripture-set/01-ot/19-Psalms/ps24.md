# Psalms 24

David testifies, The earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof, he who has clean hands and a pure heart will ascend unto the hill of the Lord, and the Lord of Hosts is the King of Glory.

# 01
THE earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.

# 02
For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.

# 03
Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?

# 04
He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

# 05
He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.

# 06
This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.

# 07
Lift up your head, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

# 08
Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.

# 09
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

# 10
Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.
