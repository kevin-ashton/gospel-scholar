# Psalms 30

David sings praises and gives thanks to the Lord—David pleads for mercy.

# 01
I WILL extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

# 02
O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

# 03
O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

# 04
Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

# 05
For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

# 06
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

# 07
LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

# 08
I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.

# 09
What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

# 10
Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.

# 11
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

# 12
To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
