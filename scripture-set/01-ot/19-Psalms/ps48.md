# Psalms 48

Zion, the city of God, the joy of the whole earth, will be established forever.

# 01
GREAT is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.

# 02
Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

# 03
God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

# 04
For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.

# 05
They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.

# 06
Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.

# 07
Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

# 08
As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.

# 09
We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.

# 10
According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

# 11
Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.

# 12
Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.

# 13
Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.

# 14
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
