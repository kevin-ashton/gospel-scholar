# Psalms 114

The Lord governs the sea and the land for the blessing of His people.

# 01
WHEN Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;

# 02
Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.

# 03
The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

# 04
The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.

# 05
What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?

# 06
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?

# 07
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;

# 08
Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
