# Psalms 61

David finds shelter in the Lord, abides in the Lord’s presence, and keeps his own vows.

# 01
HEAR my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

# 02
From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

# 03
For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.

# 04
I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.

# 05
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.

# 06
Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.

# 07
He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.

# 08
So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
