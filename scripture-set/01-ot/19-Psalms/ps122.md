# Psalms 122

David says, Go into the house of the Lord—Give thanks unto Him.

# 01
I WAS glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.

# 02
Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.

# 03
Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:

# 04
Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.

# 05
For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.

# 06
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.

# 07
Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

# 08
For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.

# 09
Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
