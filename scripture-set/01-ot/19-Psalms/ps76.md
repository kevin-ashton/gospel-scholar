# Psalms 76

God is known in Judah and dwells in Zion—He will save the meek of the earth.

# 01
IN Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.

# 02
In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.

# 03
There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.

# 04
Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.

# 05
The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.

# 06
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.

# 07
Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?

# 08
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,

# 09
When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.

# 10
Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.

# 11
Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

# 12
He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
