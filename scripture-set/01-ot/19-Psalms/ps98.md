# Psalms 98

Sing unto the Lord—All the ends of the earth will see His salvation—He comes to judge all men with equity and righteousness.

# 01
O SING unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.

# 02
The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

# 03
He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

# 04
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

# 05
Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.

# 06
With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.

# 07
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.

# 08
Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together

# 09
Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.
