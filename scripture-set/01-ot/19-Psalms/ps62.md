# Psalms 62

David praises God as his defense, his rock, and his salvation—The Lord judges men according to their works.

# 01
TRULY my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.

# 02
He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.

# 03
How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.

# 04
They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.

# 05
My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.

# 06
He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.

# 07
In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.

# 08
Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

# 09
Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.

# 10
Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

# 11
God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.

# 12
Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
