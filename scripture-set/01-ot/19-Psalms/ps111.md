# Psalms 111

The Lord is gracious and full of compassion—Holy and reverend is His name—The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

# 01
PRAISE ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.

# 02
The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.

# 03
His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.

# 04
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.

# 05
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.

# 06
He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.

# 07
The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.

# 08
They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.

# 09
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.

# 10
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
