# Psalms 100

Serve the Lord with gladness, all who are His people—Be thankful unto Him and bless His name.

# 01
MAKE a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.

# 02
Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.

# 03
Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

# 04
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

# 05
For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
