# Psalms 82

Thus says the Lord, Ye are gods and children of the Most High.

# 01
GOD standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.

# 02
How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.

# 03
Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.

# 04
Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.

# 05
They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

# 06
I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.

# 07
But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

# 08
Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
